<b>The search functionality as well as 90% of the backend are up and running. However, the layout of the candidate page as well as the frontend still require a lot of touching up. </b>

<h1>Description</h1> 
<hr></hr>

This is the early devlopment stage of a new online database that allows recuriters in Malaysia and overseas to connect with Malaysian Students studying overseas. The database will contain videos, resumes as well as relevent skill-set search tags that would simplify the talent scouting process for recruiters. Currently, I am experimenting this idea within the Malaysian Students Community at UCLA and we'll see how it goes. I will continue to develop this website and hopefully replace the current existing on which is on malaysia-ucla.netne.net

The current goal would be to design the homepage to make it as informative as possible and also a basic profile page that contains all the relevent information about the candidates.

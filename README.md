This is the early devlopment stage of a new online database that allows recuriters in Malaysia and overseas to connect with Malaysian Students studying overseas. Currently, I am experimenting this idea within the Malaysian Students Community at UCLA and we'll see where it goes

I will continue to develop this website and hopefully replace the current existing on which is on malaysia-ucla.netne.net

The current goal would be to design the Homepage to make it as informative as possible and also a basic profile page that contains all the relevent information about the candidates. 

Next stage would involve the integration of the layouts to the web framework -- Codeigniter and implementing the search function for candidates.

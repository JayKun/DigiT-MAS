                This online database originated from a proposal called DigiT which stands for Digital Talent. DigiT simpliefies the recruitement process for Malaysian companies that are interested in recruiting overseas talent.Overseas physical career fairs targeting Malaysian students are no longer the most practical way to engage with Malaysian students oversaes. Not only does it involve detailed planning and high cost, each career fair's target size is only limited to its location. In short, physical career fairs are a high cost low impact way of previewing overseas talent. Using this database, recruiters eliminate the need to organize physical career fairs but are granted easy access to student resumes and videos of students talking about themselves.

                The database also comes with a skill search function that allows recruiters to shortlist and norrow down potential candidates who possess the relevant skill. This function thereby replaces the task to manually process and filter hundreds of resume received during the career fairs.
